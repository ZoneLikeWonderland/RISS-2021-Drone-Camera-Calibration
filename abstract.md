Camera calibration is an indispensable part of drone tasks, especially in tasks that need to reconstruct the colored RGB surface. In order to make the reconstructed color better match the user's perception, white balance and vignetting reduction are mainly needed. Despite the existence of tools such as automatic white balance correction, drones in the production environment still mainly perform camera calibration by manually calibrating colors with a standard color board before every flight to ensure color consistency during the whole flight. To this end, this work proposes a neural-network-based method to replace manual operations, which enables automatic white balance and vignetting reduction through multiple cameras with a few shot on color board. The proposed method can accurately detect arbitrary color boards without any prior knowledge and adopt optimization to accomplish calibration. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for automatic camera calibration even using edge devices.
